# The piece, "When Harry Met Iannis", is a random walk in a space of
# chords from Harry Partch's 13-limit Tonality Diamond ("Genesis of a
# Music", page 454).

# A chord is coded as a list. The first element of the list is +1 for
# Otonality and -1 for Utonality. The second element is the octave
# multiplier. The third element is the Numerary Nexus (denominator for
# an Otonality, numerator for a Utonality) and the remaining elements
# are the Identities (Odentities for an Otonality and Udentities for a
# Utonality).

# The piece starts with the full Otonality chord on 1/1 = G 392 Hz.
# Then, each successive chord is derived by a randomly-chosen
# transformation. The possible transformations are:

# 1. Toggle the Otonality / Utonality selector.

# 2. Go up or down one octave, with boundaries.

# 3. Change the Numerary Nexus to one of the others.

# 4. Add or delete an Identity, with at least three and at most seven
# Identities in all chords.
